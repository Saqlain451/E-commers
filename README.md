# E-commerce Website in React JS

This project is my submission for the Pixelotech React JS Tech Challenge. The challenge was to create an e-commerce website using React JS, based on a given design. The main objective was to recreate the provided screens, implement good text arrangement, responsiveness, shadow effects, and text details,

## Design
The design for this project was provided in a Figma file. It included two screens: the main home screen and the screen that appears after clicking on the "shop now" button. The design emphasized clean and modern aesthetics, and it was my goal to faithfully recreate it using React JS.

## Implementation
I used React JS and web design skills to make the online store. I followed the design and made each part look good and work well. The website is nice to look at and easy to use, just like the design. I also made the website work well. Users can go to the shop screen from the home screen by clicking a button. The website is smooth and fast.

## Deployment
To view and interact with the prototype, I deployed the website on Vercel to ensure accessibility. The deployed version of the website can be accessed at [here](https://e-commerce-tech-test.vercel.app/) .

## Demo 

Here are some screenshots showcasing the user interface of the e-commerce website:
